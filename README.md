<h2> OPEN SOURCE LIBRARIES/FRAMEWORKS USED </h2>

<p> Chart.js </p>
<p> Montserrat font </p>

<h2> Plans for the future </h2>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p> 1. Because chart.js has a limitation to the amount of data ppints that can be accepted, i will be moving away from chart.js to a move advanced approach.</p>
		<p> 2. This site will be further upgraded to a blockchain explorer in the near future. It will be able to scan both NAV and Valence blockchains. Currently learning the process on how to scan blockchains, so this will take some time </p>
		<p> 3. Finally, this site will be able to read valanece contracts and this will be the ultimate goal of this site </p>
